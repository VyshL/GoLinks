# GoLinks

GoLinks is a web application that is lightweight and responsive, acting as a centralized link repository sorted by category. It enables quick access to frequently visited websites from a single neat interface.

Instead of bookmarking links or searching for websites over and over, GoLinks keeps useful links in one place, organized in meaningful categories for faster navigation.

-

Features

-Categorized links including Social Media, Anime, Movies/Series, Shopping, eBooks/Comics, and News
Clean and interactive user interface, with smooth transitions.
Fully responsive design for desktops and mobile devices.
Lightweight and fast application using no external libraries or frameworks.

- Basic accessibility support for keyboard navigation and ARIA labeling

-

Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Structure of the webpage

- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, responsiveness and animations

- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – DOM manipulation and user interaction

No frameworks or backend services are utilized.

-
## How It Works
1. The application should initially appear with only one main heading: **GO LINKS**.
2. Upon clicking the heading:
- The heading animates out
- The background gradient changes.

-Category choices are dynamically presented

3. Click on a category to hide the main options and display related sub-links.

4. Clicking a sub-link opens its associated website in a new browser tab.

All changes to the user interface are managed through JavaScript event listeners and CSS transitions.

Use Case

GoLinks can serve several purposes:

- A personal homepage

- A quick-launch dashboard
A minimalist alternative to bookmarks for frequently visited websites
-
What I Learned

This project gave me hands-on experience with the following:

- JavaScript DOM manipulation

Event handling and dynamic UI updates
CSS transitions and responsive design.
- Structuring a clean frontend-only project

Future Improvements

- Allow the user to add/remove custom links - Save user preferences by using local storage or backend support. - Add searching and filtering capability - Improve accessibility & animations --- Note: This project is intentionally kept simple in order to focus on core front-end concepts using only vanilla web technologies.
